We will continue to respect and implement the knowledge of our customs and values. Unwritten traditional law shall be the highest form of law for our Tribe.

Mr. Harold Brafford
Superintendent, Central California Agency
Bureau of Indian Affairs

Sacramento, California 95815

Dear Mr. Brafford:

We have received the results of the election held on August 17, 1994, by the qualified voters of the Bridgeport Indian Colony. The election was called in accordance with an order issued on May 18, 1994, which permitted the qualified voters of the Colony to vote on the adoption or rejection of a proposed Amended Constitution of the Bridgeport Indian Colony of the Bridgeport Indian Reservation, Mono County, Bridgeport, California.

As evidenced by the completed Certificate of Results of Election, the proposed Amended Constitution of the Bridgeport Indian Colony was duly adopted on August 17, 1994, by a vote of 10 for and 2 against in an election in which at least thirty percent (30%) of the 21 members registered and entitled to vote cast their ballots.

Our letter of May 18, 1994, to the Chairman, Bridgeport Indian Colony, indicated that ""we continue to find subsections 2.a.6, 2.a.13, and 2.a.15 and 2.a.19 of Article V - Powers may be contrary, in whole or in part, to Federal law because they assert powers beyond the scope of an adult Indian community "" and that the Secretary may disapprove the Constitution if adopted. The letter went on to note that the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs had requested that the Solicitor reexamine the legal basis for the opinions on which this decision was based to determine if the distinction is valid. If the Solicitor concluded that the distinction is not valid or is no longer valid because of developments in the law, such a conclusion would resolve our concerns that these enumerated powers might be contrary to applicable law. In the interim, Congress on May 31, 1994, enacted Public Law 103-263 which amended Section 16 of the Act of June 18, 1934 (IRA) (25, U.S.C. 476) by adding subsections (f) and (g) to address the development of a distinction within the Department between ""created"" and ""historic"" tribes. This subsection precludes the Department and any other agency from promulgating regulations

CERTIFIED MAIL - RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED

Honorable Edward Smith
Chairman, Chemehuevi Tribal Council
Post Office Box 1976
Havasu Lake, California 92363

Dear Chairman Smith:

On May 22, 1999, the Chemehuevi Tribal Council enacted Resolution No. 99-05-22-01, asking the Secretary of the Interior to conduct an election pursuant to Article XII of the Tribe’s Constitution and Bylaws. The purpose of the election was to allow the eligible voters of the Tribe to decide if the Constitution and Bylaws should be amended.

As the election process was being carried out, the definition of what constitutes an “eligible” voter arose as an issue. This was due to only 65 tribal members registering to vote on the proposed amendment. This caused great concern with the Tribal Council and resulted in Resolution No. Chem. R. 00-05-20-05, which outlines the Tribe’s interpretation of its Constitution in terms of what constitutes an “eligible” voter. With the small number of registered voters (65) the Tribal Council asked that the election not be held and withdrew its request for the Secretarial Election.

On September 20, 2000, the Colorado River Agency Superintendent provided you with the Bureau’s interpretation of 25 CFR Part 81, with regard to the definition of “eligible” voter. The Tribe appealed the Superintendent’s interpretation.

I have reviewed of all the documents in the file, discussed the matter with the Solicitor’s Office, and reviewed the Tribal Council’s interpretation of its Constitution. As a result of the review I am, overturning the Colorado River Agency Superintendent’s decision. The interpretation as provided in Resolution No. Chem. R. 00-05-20-05, is the main reason for this decision. Resolution No. Chem. R. 00-05-20-05, provides the following:

“NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, in order to clear up any doubts as to who is ""entitled to vote” as that term is used in Article IV, of the Tribe’s Constitution, the Chemehuevi Tribal Council

(Note: The text cut off at the bottom, so the last sentence is incomplete)I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with these requests.CERTIFICATE OF RESULTS OF ELECTION

Pursuant to an order issued by Eddie F. Brown, Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs, on November 5, 1992, the Constitution of the Chemehuevi Indian Tribe was submitted to the qualified voters of the Chemehuevi Indian Tribe, and on January 09, 1993 (date), was duly adopted/rejected by a vote of 118 (number) for, and 9 (number) against, and 3 (number) cast ballots found separated or mutilated, in an election in which at least thirty (30) percent of the 165 (number) entitled to vote cast their ballots in accordance with Section 16 of the Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984), as amended.

""registered voters will be entitled to vote, and all determinations of the sufficiency of the number of ballots cast will be based upon the number of registered voters;"" and

WHEREAS, these two sections, §81.7 and §81.11 of the Secretary’s regulations, make it clear that in order for an amendment to pass under the provisions of the IRA, the amendment must be approved: (1) by a majority of those voters who actually vote in favor of the amendment and (2) if at least 30% of those entitled to vote, register and vote in the election; and

WHEREAS, since only 65 eligible voters of the Chemehuevi Indian Tribe have registered to vote, the BIA has raised the question of whether: (1) the majority vote of the 65 registered voters is sufficient to pass the amendment, provided that at least 30% of those 65 registered voters actually vote, or (2) whether 30% of the 421 eligible voters have to register to vote and a majority of those that register, vote in favor of the measure for it to pass; and

WHEREAS, at a duly convened meeting of the Tribal Council, the BIA took the position that the 30% requirement only applies to those eligible voters who actually register, m other words, since only 65 eligible voters registered, if at least 30% or 19 voters actually cast a ballot and a majority of those 19 (i.e. 10 voters) vote in favor of the amendment, the amendment passes; and

WHEREAS, if the BIA were correct then only ten (10) voters of the 421 eligible voters the Tribe could effectuate an amendment to the Tribe’s Constitution; and

WHEREAS, the Chemehuevi Tribal Council disagrees with the position taken by the BIA at the meeting, in that the position of the Tribal Council is that: they have 421 eligible voters; in order for the amendment to pass, at least 30% of the 421 eligible voters or 126 voters must register to vote in order to meet the 30% voter quorum requirement and of those 126 eligible voters, a majority of them, or 64 voters must vote in favor of the amendment; and

WHEREAS, since only 65 eligible voters have registered to vote, it is the Tribal Council’s position that the amendment by its very terms fails, since the requisite 30% voter quorum will not have been established (i.e., less than 30% of the eligible voters will not have registered to vote and a majority of the 30% of eligible voters will not have voted in favor of the measure); and

WHEREAS, support for the Tribe’s position is found in Title 25 of the Code of Federal

and shall state the charge(s) being preferred against such person(s).
If one-third (1/3) of the eligible voters of the Chemehuevi Tribe
shall sign the recall petition(s), such petition(s) shall be
presented to the Chairperson of the Election Board.

(b) Call of Election. The Election Board shall then certify the
validity of such signatures by comparing them with the voter regis-
tration list maintained by the Election Board. If the required
number of valid signatures appear on the recall petition, the
Election Board shall call and conduct a special recall election
within sixty (60) days from the receipt of the petition(s).

(c) Voting. The ballot used at a recall election shall contain the
question: ""Shall (name of member(s) be recalled from office on the
Chemehuevi Tribal Council?"" The ballot shall contain a space
opposite such question in which the words ""Yes - No"" shall be
printed, so that the voter may indicate with a mark whether he or
she wishes to vote for or against the recall of the member(s) so
named. In the case of a recall of two (2) or more council members,
there shall be a separate ballot for each member being recalled.

(d) Recall. If a majority of the eligible voters voting in a special
recall election vote to recall the council member named in the
ballot, and PROVIDED, That twenty percent (20%) of all eligible
voters of the Chemehuevi Indian Tribe vote in said election, the
Election Board shall immediately declare the council member to be
recalled from office and his or her seat shall be declared vacant.

- 9 -Hereby interprets the language ""entitled to vote"" contained in the
Amendment Section of the Tribe's Constitution to mean all persons
who are eligible to vote under the Constitution, (i.e., all enrolled
Chemehuevi Tribal members possessing one-sixteenth (1/16) or more
degree of Chemehuevi blood who are 18 years of age or older).

“BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Tribal Council request that
the BIA not conduct the election on the proposed amendment since
only 65 voters registered for the election, which is less than the 30%
necessary to pass the amendment, thus the amendment fails by
operation of law.”

Based on the Chemehuevi Tribal Council’s interpretation, the Bureau will in this instance
defer to the Tribal Council’s interpretation of who is eligible to vote in the Secretarial
election to amend the Tribe’s Constitution. It is imperative that the Tribal Council
understand that the interpretation will play a major factor when processing the Tribe’s future
requests for such an election. It will be important for the Tribe to take measures to ensure
that tribal voter participation in any future elections meets the Tribe’s interpretation of the
requirements of its constitution

I therefore, overturn the Colorado River Agency Superintendent’s decision of September 20,
2000, and defer to the Chemehuevi Tribal Council’s interpretation of eligible voters to be
used in future determination of the 30% requirement for holding a Secretarial election.

Sincerely,

WAYNE N. NORDWALL
