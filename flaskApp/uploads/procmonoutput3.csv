ORDINANCE NO. 12-01-91

ORDINANCE OF THE GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE SHER-
WOOD VALLEY RANCHERIA DELEGATING CERTAIN
LIMITED POWERS TO THE TRIBAL COUNCIL.

The General Council of the Sherwood Valley Rancheria hereby
ordains as follows.

SECTION ONE. Findings and Declarations.

The General Council hereby finds and declares as follows:

1. The Constitution and Bylaws of the Sherwood Valley
Rancheria, adopted by the qualified voters of the Sherwood Valley
Rancheria on March 9, 1974, establishes the General Council as
the governing body of the rancheria. (Art. III, Sec. 1.)

2. The Governing Council consists of all qualified voters
of the rancheria.

3. The Constitution also establishes a Tribal Council, con-
sisting of the General Council officers and two General Council
members.

4. In Article VI, entitled: Powers of the General Council
and the Tribal Council, the General Council is provided
enumerated powers. However, no authority is specifically
delegated to the Tribal Council.

5. Nevertheless, the Tribal Council has for nearly twenty
years, since the Constitution was first adopted, exercised cer-
tain limited powers which have enabled the Sherwood Valley Ranch-
eria to conduct its daily business, establish a housing
authority, acquire land for the tribe and enter and administer
various agreements with the federal and state governments.

6. These powers were intended to be included in the Con-
stitution as originally adopted but were inadvertently omitted;
The best evidence of this intent is the longstanding practice
ratified by both the tribe and federal government.

7. This ordinance is necessary to clarify the authority of
the Tribal Council to conduct business on behalf of the rancheria
and to represent the rancheria's interests.

SECTION TWO. Powers of the Sherwood Valley Rancheria Tribal
Council.

The Sherwood Valley Rancheria Tribal Council is hereby
delegated the following powers of the General Council which it is
authorized to exercise on behalf of the Rancheria membership.
